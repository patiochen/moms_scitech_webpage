    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
        As dense uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) operations become more prevalent, there is agrowing need for ground-based monitoring of multiple heterogeneous airspace objects(including UASs, crewed aircraft, birds, and projectiles) in airspace volumes. Monitoringneeds in these settings are often track- (trajectory-) centered, encompassing: 1) fast detectionof objects that impinge on the airspace, 2) recording and differentiation of multiple objecttracks in sensing data, 3) matching and location of the tracks in geographical coordinates usingmultiple sensors, and 4) real-time alarming of object conflicts and other scenarios ofconcern. This article reports on a distributed system for real-time track-based monitoring ofmultiple mobile airspace objects, which uses video cameras arranged in two or more noncollocatedpods for monitoring. The distributed architecture of the monitoring system isdescribed, and the methods/algorithms used for comprehensive track monitoring aredeveloped. Multi-track monitoring is demonstrated in the scope of two flight campaignsinvolving multi-UAS operations, conducted near Fairbanks, Alaska, as well as demonstrationsin Langley, Virginia and College Station, TX.
